## Money and Presidential Nominees for Career Ambassadors
When the role of career ambassador was created in 1955, presidential nominees were required to have served a minimum of 15 years in a government agency, including 3 years in a government ministerial role among other requirements. These specific requirements were repealed with the 1980 Foregin Service Act.
Current events have brought into question the qualifications of recent presidential nominees for ambassadorships along with the intentions of the president and the role of money in the nominee process.

I used various exploratory data analysis techniques to gather inferences on the trends in nominee experience and skills per nominating president along with designing experiments for proving statistical
 relevance of my findings.
